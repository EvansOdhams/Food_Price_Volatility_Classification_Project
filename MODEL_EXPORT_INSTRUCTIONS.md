# 📦 Export Trained Models - Instructions

## Current Status: ⚠️ Models NOT Exported

**Models are trained but NOT saved to files yet.**

---

## 📋 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Open the Jupyter Notebook
Open `Food_Price_Volatility_Classification_Project.ipynb` in Google Colab

### Step 2: Add New Cell After Model Training
Add a new cell at the end of your notebook with this code:

```python
# ==============================================================================
# EXPORT TRAINED MODELS TO PICKLE FILES
# ==============================================================================

import pickle
import os

print("💾 Saving trained models to pickle files...")
print("="*60)

# Create models directory if it doesn't exist
os.makedirs('models', exist_ok=True)

# Save all models and their scalers
models_to_save = {
    'logistic_regression': {'model': lr_model, 'scaler': scaler_lr},
    'decision_tree': {'model': dt_model, 'scaler': None},
    'random_forest': {'model': rf_model, 'scaler': None},
    'svm': {'model': svm_model, 'scaler': scaler_svm},
    'xgboost': {'model': xgb_model, 'scaler': None},
    'neural_network': {'model': nn_model, 'scaler': scaler_nn}
}

for model_name, model_data in models_to_save.items():
    filepath = f'models/{model_name}_model.pkl'
    with open(filepath, 'wb') as f:
        pickle.dump(model_data['model'], f)
    
    if model_data['scaler'] is not None:
        scaler_path = f'models/{model_name}_scaler.pkl'
        with open(scaler_path, 'wb') as f:
            pickle.dump(model_data['scaler'], f)
    
    print(f"✅ Saved: {filepath}")

# Also save label encoder for XGBoost
if 'le' in locals():
    le_path = 'models/label_encoder.pkl'
    with open(le_path, 'wb') as f:
        pickle.dump(le, f)
    print(f"✅ Saved: {le_pathый}")

# Save feature names for prediction
feature_names_path = 'models/feature_names.pkl'
with open(feature_names_path, 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(list(X_train.columns), f)
print(f"✅ Saved: {feature_names_path}")

print("\n" + "="*60)
print("✅ All models exported successfully!")
print("="*60)
```

### Step 3: Download the Models
After running the cell, download the `models/` folder from Colab:
- Right-click on the `models/` folder
- Select "Download"
- Extract to your project's `streamlit_app/` directory

### Step 4: Update Streamlit App
The `app.py` file will need to be updated to load and use these models (future enhancement).

## 📁 Expected Model Files

After export, you should have these files in `models/`:

```
models/
├── decision_tree_model.pkl
├── random_forest_model.pkl
├── xgboost_model.pkl
├── neural_network_model.pkl
├── svm_model.pkl
├── svm_scaler.pkl
├── logistic_regression_model.pkl
├── logistic_regression_scaler.pkl
├── neural_network_scaler.pkl
├── label_encoder.pkl
└── feature_names.pkl
```

---

## ⚠️ Note for GitHub

**The models directory is NOT included in the GitHub repository** because:
- Large file sizes
- Models can be regenerated from the notebook
- Keeps repository lightweight

---

## 🎯 Current App Status

The Streamlit app currently uses a **simplified prediction logic** (rule-based) for demonstration purposes. To use the actual trained models, you need to:

1. Export models (instructions above)
2. Download models folder
3. Update `app.py` to load models and make real predictions
